# 2D Fighting Game Development Notes

This document contains notes about the development of the 2D fighting game.

## Game Structure

The game is built with a simple architecture:

1. **FightingGame class**: Main game controller that handles:
   - Game loop
   - Input processing
   - Collision detection
   - Rendering

2. **Fighter class**: Represents each player character with:
   - Position and movement
   - Attack mechanics
   - Health and damage system
   - State management

## Implementation Details

### Physics System
- Simple gravity implementation
- Basic collision detection between fighters
- Ground collision

### Combat System
- Two attack types: punch and kick
- Attack cooldowns
- Damage calculation
- Health reduction

### Animation States
Currently using simple state machine with these states:
- idle
- walk
- jump
- crouch
- punch
- kick
- hurt

## Future Enhancements

### Short-term improvements
- Add proper sprite-based animations
- Implement blocking mechanics
- Add sound effects for attacks and movements
- Improve collision detection

### Medium-term goals
- Add special moves with specific button combinations
- Create multiple character types with different abilities
- Add stage hazards and interactive elements

### Long-term vision
- Implement AI for single-player mode
- Add online multiplayer capability
- Create a story mode with progression
